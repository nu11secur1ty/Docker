Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Update Your System
First, make sure your package list is up to date,
```
apt update -y
apt upgrade -y
```
Install Docker
If Docker is not already installed on your system, you can install it using the following commands,
```
apt install docker.io
```
Install Docker Compose
To install Docker Compose, you can use the below commands. You may need to download the latest version of Docker Compose from the official GitHub repository,
```
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose
```
The above command will download and install the latest version of Docker Compose.

Verify Docker Compose Version
Check if Docker Compose was installed successfully by running,

docker-compose --version
Output:

root@server:~# docker-compose --version
Docker Compose version v2.27.0
root@server:~# 
Done.
